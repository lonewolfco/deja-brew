# deja-brew

The Deja Brew application can be used to seach for breweries, with the search criteria of city entered. 

Once searched, a list of breweries will show on one panel, and a map feature on the tandem panel.

The brewery list will display the name, address, phone number and email address to connect with the establishment.

There is also a Map It! button to provide a pushpin in the map for the exact location in relation to the city entered.

Once a city is searched, the city name is saved in the history feature on the upper right corner of the page. The history can be cleared for a new search or to purge traces of past searches. This feature was added for user convenience.

There is also an About page in the upper right corner which features the photos and information for the creators of this application. Some of which are beer enthusiasts and helped spur the conception of Deja Brew!
